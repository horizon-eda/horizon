# Getting Help

For general questions on usage (How do I?), start a topic on https://horizon-eda.discourse.group/. 

Only if you're sure that you've found a bug our have a thought-out enhancement proposal, open an issue. In doubt, start a topic on discourse first.

For one-off questions that don't require much back-and-forth, feel free to join `#horizon` on freenode and ask your questions there.
